🧱 STACK
A Stack is a Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure.

Think of it like a stack of plates — the last plate you put on top is the first one you take off.

🔁 Operations:
Push – Add an item to the top

Pop – Remove the top item

Peek – View the top item without removing

isEmpty – Check if stack is empty

📦 Example with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:
Push these elements:

Push 1
Stack: [1]

Push 2
Stack: [1, 2]

Push 3
Stack: [1, 2, 3]

Push 4
Stack: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Push 5
Stack: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Pop operations:
plaintext
Copy
Edit
Pop → 5
Stack: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Pop → 4
Stack: [1, 2, 3]

Peek → 3
✅ Last in = 5 → First out.
