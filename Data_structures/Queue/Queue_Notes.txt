🚶 QUEUE
A Queue is a First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure.

Think of it like a line at a ticket counter — the first person to enter the line is the first to get served.

🔁 Operations:
Enqueue – Add item to the rear

Dequeue – Remove item from the front

Front – View the item at the front

isEmpty – Check if queue is empty

📦 Example with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:
Enqueue these elements:

Enqueue 1
Queue: [1]

Enqueue 2
Queue: [1, 2]

Enqueue 3
Queue: [1, 2, 3]

Enqueue 4
Queue: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Enqueue 5
Queue: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Dequeue operations:
plaintext
Copy
Edit
Dequeue → 1
Queue: [2, 3, 4, 5]

Dequeue → 2
Queue: [3, 4, 5]

Front → 3
✅ First in = 1 → First out.
